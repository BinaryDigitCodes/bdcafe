You know what dawned on me today? After many years of short form "blogs", I don't want to be a blogger. I miss tumblr style/short form content. I don't sit down and write long stories or articles. I've changed a bit and I think it's why I struggle with fomo and going back and forth to social media and back to my own platforms trying to blog.

I love working on my website, making pages, and aesthetics. For example I signed back up for Tumblr and am so happy browing and reblogging. On Instagram, I usually consume but don't really post, unless it's for streaming or music content. On Mastodon I usually consume, boost, and sometimes post short things. It's just funny how you realize you change after a while. And I don't always need a blog, but when I want to write something I can do it here as a note, which is the whole point of a digital garden, and send it out to socials. 

This is just a reminder to myself that I can do whatever I want here. That's the whole point of the indieweb and to have fun again online. ðŸ’–
