### A Personal Photo Gallery

I've set up a photo gallery for snapshots using [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) over at [binarydigit.photos](https://binarydigit.photos). This is for personal photos and galleries, not a porfolio site.

### Photography Porfolio

At the same time, I'm working on more curated photography with my Fuji camera and iPhone on [Glass](https://glass.photo/binarydigit). This will be more portfolio pieces instead of snapshots.

### Livestreaming

I livestream music mixes and gameplay on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/binarydigit/about). I'm working on a tiny "studio" at home so I can stream consistently - a big goal this year.

### This Personal Website

I’ve set up this fun website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). A while back my brain didn’t click well with static site generators, but now I’m loving it! I’m using the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme which is incredibly customizable and has so many features.
