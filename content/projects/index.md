## This Website Redesign

I'm redoing my website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and loving it so far. A while back my brain didn't click well with static site generators, but now I'm loving it.

I'm using the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme which is incredibly customizable and has so many features!

## A Personal Photo Gallery

I couldn't resist the deal to purchase [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) to set up a personal [photo gallery](https://binarydigit.photos), which is especially good for moments where I want to share albums of events, and keep my photos on my own hosting. I can set up public, private, and password protected albums! 

## Livestreaming

I stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/binarydigit/about) and sometimes to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/BinaryDigit). I'm working on getting a schedule back on track with a mix of playing games one day, then DJ sets the next. I'm also working on building an offline music collection.
