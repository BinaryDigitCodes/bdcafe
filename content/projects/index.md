## This Website Redesign

I'm redoing my website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and loving it so far. A while back my brain didn't click well with static site generators, but now I'm loving it.

I'm using the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme which is incredibly customizable and has so many features!

## Livestream

I stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/binarydigit/about) with a fallback to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/BinaryDigit). I'm working on getting a schedule back on track with a mix of playing games one day, then DJ sets the next.
