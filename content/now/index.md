A /now page is a great way to share what’s going on in your life [now](https://nownownow.com/about).

I love to be creative in my personal time (code, art, photography), support open source, and love all things technical, so right now everything intersects well. 

## Doing

- Rediscovering things that bring me joy, such a photography, music, light coding/making things pretty. I need more beauty in my life so I want to create it.

(I swing from cozy to volent depending on my mood 🤣)


## Working

- At a digital media publisher where I work with editorial staff and work with a developer team to keep our websites afloat. 

## Living

- In Detroit with my boyfriend and 2 pups
