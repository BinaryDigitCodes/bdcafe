Hi I'm B, a New Yorker living in the Metro Detroit area 👋🏽 My work background is in tech (I was a systems engineer, part time web dev, and now a manager). I would love to find more diverse folks in gaming, tech, music and all things creative. I love to travel, take photos, game on my PC, PS5 and Switch, stream, tweak code and always learning something new. ✨

I’m doing a digital overhaul for the next few months and would like to make this site a digital garden, or in my case, a _digital cafe_; a personal space to gather projects, what I'm working on, thoughts, and notes. 

I blog events and photos on my [blog](https://blog.binarydigit.cafe), post random snippets on [Mastodon](https://mstdn.games/@BinaryDigit) and you can see all of my other work on my [links](https://binarydigit.omg.lol) page. Thanks for visiting!
