Hi I'm B, a New Yorker living in the Metro Detroit area 👋🏽 My work background is in tech (I was a systems engineer, part time web dev, and now a manager). I love to travel, take photos, game on my PC, PS5 and Switch, live stream on Twitch, mix music, tweak code and always learning something new. ✨

I’m doing a digital overhaul for the next few months and would like to make this site a digital garden, or in my case, a _digital cafe_; a personal space to gather projects, what I'm working on, thoughts, and notes. You can read about my projects and click on my social links above. Thanks for visiting!
