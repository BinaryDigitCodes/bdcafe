I'm so happy to get Chevereto installed on a [new domain](https://binarydigit.photos/?list=images&sort=date_asc&page=1)! They had a great sale on their one time purchase software, so I grabbed a copy. I wanted some more bells and whistles than their free version.

I'm going to use this to upload galleries for travel (to share with friends) or blog posts. I still need to upload more to photos Glass, but those photos are edited and curated.

To this gallery I've uploaded some photos from TwitchCon that just passed. Next up is most likely photos when visiting NY around Christmas. And most likely a dog photo album 🥰
