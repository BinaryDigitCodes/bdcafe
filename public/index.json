I started doing DJ mixes on Twitch in March and was in my element, having so much fun and loving when chat comes in and hypes up the vibes with emotes and words of encouragement. I love entertaining folks and music is the universal language for us all! Music streams are a great break from doing gaming or chatting streams, which I also love, but find tough to do if my energy isn\u0026rsquo;t in it. Granted streaming in general has been tough this year due to changes in my body and lack of energy, but I\u0026rsquo;m on a good road to getting back to my old self - my mind, my body, and getting back the energy I want for 2024. I\u0026rsquo;m in a lovely supportive space with room to grow and want to take advtange of that!\nBinaryDigit\u0026rsquo;s Twitch Streamer Recap 2023 BinaryDigit\u0026rsquo;s Twitch Viewer Recap 2023 How was your Twitch recap?

After many years of short form \u0026ldquo;blogs\u0026rdquo;, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a blogger. I miss tumblr style/short form content. I don\u0026rsquo;t sit down and write long stories or articles. I\u0026rsquo;ve changed a bit and I think it\u0026rsquo;s why I struggle with fomo and going back and forth to social media and back to my own platforms trying to blog.\nI love working on my website, making pages, and aesthetics. For example I signed back up for Tumblr and am so happy browing and reblogging. On Instagram, I usually consume but don\u0026rsquo;t really post, unless it\u0026rsquo;s for streaming or music content. On Mastodon I usually consume, boost, and sometimes post short things. It\u0026rsquo;s just funny how you realize you change after a while. And I don\u0026rsquo;t always need a blog, but when I want to write something I can do it here as a note, which is the whole point of a digital garden, and send it out to socials.\nThis is just a reminder to myself that I can do whatever I want here. That\u0026rsquo;s the whole point of the indieweb and to have fun again online. 💖\n","date":"Dec 10 2023","permalink":"/notes/notablog/","section":"Notes and Ideas","summary":"You know what dawned on me today?","title":"Not a Blogger"},{"content":"Thank you for your submission! 📨\n","date":"Dec 1 2023","permalink":"/thankyou/","section":"","summary":"Thank you for your submission!","title":"Thank You"},{"content":" ","date":"Nov 27 2023","permalink":"/guestbook/","section":"","summary":" ","title":"Guestbook"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m so happy to get Chevereto installed on a new domain!

I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wrap my head around the complexity of them, or why I would need one. But then, I got to know the indie web, aka, the small web. The movement of people going back to focus on their own websites, owning a domain name, and publishing content on your website then out to other services, aka POSSE - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. I always wanted to keep that motto all these years, but kept jumping around from a social blog to another social blog, to Wordpress, and back. Now I\u0026rsquo;ve landed on micro.blog, but even want to avoid using that in the future if I can help it. It helps save a few bucks a month as well as learn the intricacies of static site generators.\nTinkering # Since micro.blog is built with Hugo, I went back to trying to learn it. I first edited my micro.blog theme with the custom editor, and then decided to give Hugo a try on my own. Lo and behold, it finally \u0026ldquo;clicked\u0026rdquo;. I tried a couple of themes, and then landed upton this one, named Blowfish. It\u0026rsquo;s so awesome! It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly customizable and helped me learn so many details about Hugo. I then was able to push my git repo to Netlify and have it hosted there for free! I\u0026rsquo;m super happy that I\u0026rsquo;m able to finally have a digital garden (cafe) and blog on my own domain, not worried about a major service going down, an acquisition, or paying a ton of money for hosting each month. I hope I can keep it running for a while and never go back to hosting again (unless they offer something that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist). Next up, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to import old posts.\nThanks for reading!\n","date":"Nov 17 2023","permalink":"/notes/hugo-setup/","section":"Notes and Ideas","summary":"Static Site Generators # For ages I resisted static site generators.","title":"My Website Setup"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 17 2023","permalink":"/tags/web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"web"},{"content":"Welcome to my attempt at a new site with Hugo, finally, on my own domain and hosted via netlify/github!
