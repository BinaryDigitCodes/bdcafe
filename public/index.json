I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wrap my head around the complexity of them, or why I would need one. But then, I got to know the indie web, aka, the small web. The movement of people going back to focus on their own websites, owning a domain name, and publishing content on your website then out to other services, aka POSSE - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. I always wanted to keep that motto all these years, but kept jumping around from a social blog to another social blog, to Wordpress, and back. Now I\u0026rsquo;ve landed on micro.blog, but even want to avoid using that in the future if I can help it. It helps save a few bucks a month as well as learn the intricacies of static site generators.\nTinkering # Since micro.blog is built with Hugo, I went back to trying to learn it. I first edited my micro.blog theme with the custom editor, and then decided to give Hugo a try on my own. Lo and behold, it finally \u0026ldquo;clicked\u0026rdquo;. I tried a couple of themes, and then landed upton this one, named Blowfish. It\u0026rsquo;s so awesome! It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly customizable and helped me learn so many details about Hugo. I then was able to push my git repo to Netlify and have it hosted there for free! I\u0026rsquo;m super happy that I\u0026rsquo;m able to finally have a digital garden (cafe) and blog on my own domain, not worried about a major service going down, an acquisition, or paying a ton of money for hosting each month. I hope I can keep it running for a while and never go back to hosting again (unless they offer something that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist). Next up, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to import old posts.\nThanks for reading!\n","date":"Nov 17 2023","permalink":"/posts/hugo-setup/","section":"Posts","summary":"Static Site Generators # For ages I resisted static site generators.","title":"My Website Setup"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 17 2023","permalink":"/tags/web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"web"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 16 2023","permalink":"/tags/blog/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"blog"},{"content":"Welcome to my attempt at blogging with Hugo, finally, on my own domain and hosted via netlify/github!
