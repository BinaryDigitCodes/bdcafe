I\u0026rsquo;ve attempted to do many things here:\nAdd webmentions, since ideally that would be the way folks respond or comment to my self hosted blog. I really like the fediverse and the indieweb, so hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ve installed this correctly. If not I\u0026rsquo;ll keep trying :D\nAdded back the CS.SJoy.lol webring, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to set up the Indieweb web ring (first I need to finish some auth specs)\nI\u0026rsquo;d love how to figure out how to import existing blog posts from my micro.blog, so eventually I can keep everything here. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this is possible, and it\u0026rsquo;s not a huge deal anyway if I can get everything set up properly. I can restart a blog at any time.\nIf you enjoy your stay, feel free to subscribe via RSS or follow me on the fediverse! @binarydigit.cafe@binarydigit.cafe\n","date":"Nov 16 2023","permalink":"/posts/hello/","section":"Posts","summary":"Welcome to my attempt at blogging with Hugo, finally, on my own domain and hosted via netlify/github!","title":"Hi and Welcome to the Cafe"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 16 2023","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 16 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":" BinaryDigit in reply to: @aaronpk\nTrying out this guide to sending webmentions\n","date":"Nov 16 2023","permalink":"/posts/test/","section":"Posts","summary":"BinaryDigit in reply to: @aaronpk","title":"Testing Webmentions"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 16 2023","permalink":"/tags/web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"web"},{"content":"A /now page is a great way to share what’s going on in your life now.\nI love to be creative in my personal time (code, art, photography), support open source, and love all things technical, so right now everything intersects well.\nDoing # Rediscovering things that bring me joy, such a photography, music, light coding/making things pretty.
